The recognition of named entities as the process of automatic identification of the entities present in a text and consequent classification into predefined categories such as \\\"person\\\", \\\"organization\\\", \\\"position\\\" is a quite common activity and expect for English, trained models with spaCy offer few labels that could be improved through training.\\n\",\n",
